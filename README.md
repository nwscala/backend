# Shopify Image Repository Project - The Imaginarium (Backend)

To start, you'll also need [Shopify Image Repository Project - The Imaginarium (Frontend)](https://github.com/nwscala/shopify-image-repository-frontend).
Then, Fork or Clone both this and the other repository into the same parent folder.
Then, cd into the backend folder and run `rails s` to start the backend server.
Then, cd into the frontend folder and run `yarn start` to start the frontend app.
Then, your browser should automatically open a webpage for you automatically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost/3000) but if it doesn't, you can always navigate there manually. (FYI: the ruby server is hosted at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost/3001))
Once you reach the webpage, with both the backend and the frontend up and running, you can start to use the app by inputting links to images found on the wider web and titles for the images, both of which must be unique, and alt text for the images, which simply must exist.
You can also remove images from the webpage by clicking on the `Delete` button found on every image card.
